# Penguin Chat JS (in development)

A Penguin Chat 2 emulator, written in Node.js with the use of Express to imitate PHP's long polling technique. Penguin Chat 2 originally used long polling, but we can use this in Node.js as well!

# History

Penguin Chat 2 was used to test Club Penguin. This simple avatar chat is truly a piece of nostalgia and internet 'gaming' history.
